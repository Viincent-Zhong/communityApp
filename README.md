# CommunityApp
The idea of the app is to create a community where people can engage in various topics through different rooms.

The user is able to create a room (chat, meeting, sells), and then all the other users is able to see it and react on it.

The users also have a profile page where they can comment on each other profile.

## Launch the app

```
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
